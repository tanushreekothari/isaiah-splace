# HTML, JavaScript, CSS Calendar project

## Overview
Write a calendar application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Requirements
1. [x] The user interface should generally have two panes.

2. [x] One pane should have a calendar with clickable days

3. [x] the other should have time slots for a selected day

4. [x] The time slots can be in any increment you wish - hourly, 30-minutes, 15-minutes, etc

5. [x] Each time slot must be able to have a text message attached to make appointments.


## Walk-through
1. The user clicks on a day on the calendar, say, December 25th.
2. The time slot panel updates to reflect the appointments for that day.
3. The user then has the ability to edit an appointment for a given time slot, even for a slot that has no prior appointment.

## Resources, page render
1. [x] Page makes use of style sheets (external, internal, or in-line).
2. [ ] Page renders similarly and functions in major browsers, using the same code (IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari)
3. [x] Page does not use cookies
4. [x] Page does not submit to any forms
5. [x] Page uses JavaScript objects or local storage to store the scheduling data
      (data does not need to be persistent through a browser refresh)
6. [x] Page does not use plugins such as Flash, anything proprietary to a single browser such as VBScript in IE
7. [x] you may use libraries such as jQuery or FullCalendar

## looking at
 + quality and organizational structure of the code
 + ease of use of the user interface, look and feel, and feature set.  
 + understand how you develop software and your thinking behind the process
